With this project my goal will be to practice carrying out End-to-End machine learning projects. Which will involve downloading real data from public sources, cleaning it, deriving inferences using different ML algorithms, and finally visualizing the results in an effective manner. 

I will begin with following examples compiled from different resources and then I will combine them with my approach.
